**CHECKLIST IDEA**


## Priority
##### What is the priority level of getting your checklist item onto the website? Why should this idea be prioritized such? Where does this idea fall in reference to other outstanding ideas for the platform?

[Your answer here]



## Impact and Unintended Consequences
#### What is the **collective impact** of many people executing on your checklist item?

[Your answer here]



#### What are potential **unintended consequences** of facilitating mass participation in your idea?

[Your answer here]



#### How should the results of individuals completing your checklist item be communicated on the petition dashboard?

[Your answer here]




## Tangibility, Provability, Measurability
#### What metric(s) would indicate an individual's participation? What can the website collect, measure, or tally to prove to the community that others are completing your task, and prove to our representation that we aren't messing around?

[Your answer here]



#### How would participation be validated / proven? Examples: Pictures of withdrawal receipts indicating that funds were removed from the big banks, screenshots of subscription removals, screenshots of strike notices.

[Your answer here]





## Feasibility and Logistics

#### How might the checklist item be implemented as simply as possible, by a small, one-person development team? What challenges might arise in developing a solution before launch?

[Your answer here]



#### What are potential logistical bottlenecks in validating participation? Examples: validating unsubscribe pages from extractionist payment models that add little end-user value.

[Your answer here]



#### Avoiding compounding bottlenecks - adding a checklist item incurs logistical debt, in that partication will need to be measured and validated long-term, on top of developing and maintaining new ones. How can validation be simplified so that the developer can focus on developing new checklist items, campaigns, and improving the platform?
