<h4>Step 3: Upload your withdrawal receipt</h4>

<div class="info">
  <h4>Why are we asking for proof?</h4>
  <p>
    Late-Stage is different from any other petition campaign in that it's used to prove to lawmakers
    and those that maintain the status-quo that we are fighting <strong>ourselves</strong> against the
    institutions they maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also want the people in our community to feel the tangible impact. Proof of participation
    fuels the campaign's credibility, encourages the more hesitant to participate, and creates a
    sense of solidarity and real accomplishment.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we get enough withdrawal receipts, we're hoping to create <a
      href="https://mosaically.com"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">a mosaic</a
    > of all participants' withdrawals as a message of mass dissent.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>Redact any personal info</strong> from the receipt that you don't want on the Internet. The
  image need only contain the amount withdrawn, and the institution from which the amount was removed.
