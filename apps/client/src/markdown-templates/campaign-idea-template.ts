**CAMPAIGN IDEA**


## Deadlines
##### What is the priority level of getting your campaign onto the website and launching it? Why should this idea be prioritized such? Where does this idea fall in reference to other outstanding ideas for the platform?

[Your answer here]



**When would the campaign be launched?** [Ideal launch date]

**When would the campaign end?** [Ideal end date]

**Should the website still make the action(s) within the campaign available for users to perform after the campaign ends? In other words, is the campaign still relevant to our mission after the deadline?** [Yes or No]



## Impact and Unintended Consequences
#### What is the **desired end-state** of the campaign? What **impact** will it have?

[Your answer here]



#### What are potential **unintended consequences** for concentrating community activity on your campaign within a short-term timeframe?

[Your answer here]



#### How should the results of the campaign be communicated on the website?

[Your answer here]




## Tangibility, Provability, Measurability
#### What metric(s) would indicate community participation? What can the website collect, measure, or tally to prove to the community that the initiative is working, and prove to our representation that we aren't messing around?

[Your answer here]



#### How would participation be validated / proven? Examples: Pictures of withdrawal receipts indicating that funds were removed from the big banks, screenshots of subscription removals, screenshots of strike notices.

[Your answer here]





## Feasibility and Logistics

#### Pre-launch - How might the campaign be implemented as simply as possible, by a small, one-person development team? What challenges might arise in developing a solution before launch?

[Your answer here]



#### Launch - How, where, and to which audience(s) should the campaign be communicated to ensure widest adoption and participation possible?

[Your answer here]



#### What are potential logistical bottlenecks in validating participation? Examples: validating the amount of money removed from Wells Fargo in the withdrawal receipt matches the participant's claimed amount, and validating that they moved funds to a better financial institution.

[Your answer here]



#### Ideally, the development efforts for implementing and launching a campaign would go unwasted in the long-term, but we want to avoid compounding bottlenecks. If the actions in the campaign remain available on the website even after its end date (the campaign is no longer featured at the top of the petition page), is validation by a human still required?
